Portfolio Project


This is a portfolio project that showcases how to use Vite, React, Three.js, and Email.js to create an interactive portfolio website.
The website contains a home page, portfolio page, and contact page. 
The portfolio page displays a gallery of 3D models created using Three.js, and the contact page uses Email.js to allow users to send messages directly from the website.

Technologies Used
Vite: A build tool for JavaScript applications that provides an efficient development server and fast builds.
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Three.js: A JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a browser.
Email.js: A client-side JavaScript library that allows for easy and secure email sending directly from a web page.



File Structure :
The src directory contains the React components, pages, and utility functions used in the website. The components directory contains reusable React components, the pages directory contains the main pages of the website, and the utils directory contains utility functions.

The public directory contains static assets such as 3D models, images, and the index.html file.
